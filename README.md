**This build tool is currently under development.**

If you are one of the brave few who feel like experimenting with this tool, here's how to install and run it:

1. Install via npm or yarn:
```
npm i -g create-js-project

yarn global add create-js-project
```
2. Create a project, optionally providing a [project-name] for your project, or use the npm initializer:
```
create-js-project [project-name]

npm init js-project [project-name]
```
3. Answer the questions, such as your project's name and desired template.
4. Wait until the installation is complete.
5. Start developing!
